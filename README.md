X6502
=====

A [6502](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) CPU emulator written
in [Elixir](elixir-lang.org).

## TODO

 * Implement BCD arithmetic (although doesn't seem too useful right now)
 * Implement clock simulation (so we can run the cpu for an exact number of
 clock cycles, useful to synchronize it with other emulated hardware)
